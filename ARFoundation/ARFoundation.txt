Setup for ARFoundation (Only suppported on ARCore supported devices)
[Link for ARCore Supported Devices List : https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices ]

[Project Setup]

Step 1: Create a new 3D project in Unity.

Step 2: Go to project settings, switch platform to android. Set the Company name and Product name along with the Package Name.
	Turn off Multithreaded Rendering and remove Vulkan graphics API.
	Set Minimum API level to 25 and close player settings.

Step 3: Open Windows->Package Manager, Install "AR Foundation" and "ARCore XR Plugin". 

	For Unity 2018:
	AR Foundation 1.0.0 — preview.22 
	ARCore XR Plugin 1.0.0 — preview.24
	[Incase you don't see the above packages, Click on Advanced->Show Preview Packages.]
	
	For Unity 2019:
	AR Foundation 2.1.8 / AR Foundation 3.1.3
	ARCore XR Plugin 2.1.8 / ARCore XR Plugin 3.1.3 

[Note: For Unity 2018 do not update the AR Foundation and ARCore XR Plugin version above the ones specified above as it will throw errors.]


[Scene Setup]

Step 4: Right-click on heirarchy, XR->"AR Session"
	Right-click on heirarchy, XR->"AR Session Origin"	(AR Session Origin has its own AR camera so delete any other cameras in the scene.)

Step 5: [This step is version Specific ] 
	For Unity 2018: 
	Add "AR Plane Manager" inbuilt script to "AR Session Orgin" GameObject.

	For Unity 2019:
	Add "AR Plane Manager" and "AR Raycast Manager" inbuilt scripts to "AR Session Orgin" GameObject.

	[Note :The above mentioned scripts can be added by clicking on Add Component in the Inspector Panel and then Searching for them.]

Step 6: Add a Cube or any other 3D Object in the scene. Reposition the cube so that the AR Camera can see it.
	[ AR Camera is a Child of AR Session Origin ] 

Now, you are done with the setup process. Build and Run the application on a ARCore supported Device and You Should see a cube ( or any other object) on your screen.


[Deploy game objects in the environment on tap using raycasting]

Step 7: Add a Placement Indicator gameObject. [Can be any quad or plane and should be present in the inspector]
	Add a model you want to deploy. [Should be prefabbed and not in inspector]

Step 8: Create an empty GameObject. Attach the provided script to the Empty Game Object and fill the details in inspector panel.
	For Unity 2018: Use the ARTapToPlace_2018.cs file.
	For Unity 2019: Use the ARTapToPlace.cs file.
		
	Note: 1) There is no need to give Placement Indicator Gameobject to "Plane Prefab" in "AR Plane Manager"
	      2) Incase if your Placement Indicator jitters go to the "Tracked Pose Driver" component of you AR Camera change the Update Type to "Update"

	Build and Enjoy!
